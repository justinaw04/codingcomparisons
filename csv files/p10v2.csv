10,20:28,A2-1,,Robot,Hi it's so nice to meet you. I'm looking forward to spending time with you my friends at UW Madison prepared a booklet so I can teach you what I can do. One thing you need to know about me is that I sometimes have difficulty understanding what you say. So the best way to communicate with me is through some special tags can you first show me the special tag on the back of the book named read with Misty. perfect now you know how to let me know which book you want to read you can start reading the book named read with Misty to me,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,21:38,A2-1,,Parent,I'm doing the reading,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,21:39,A2-1,,Researcher,yes you can do the reading okay,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,21:42,A2-1,,Parent,read with Misty is that you and Misty?,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

10,22:17,A2-1,,Robot,how many caps can you see on the bottom of this page,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,22:21,A2-1,,Child,3,,,,,,,,,1,,1,,3,1,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,22:27,A2-1,,Parent,"to hear mistys response to the question press answer. Okay, now tell her",1,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,22:33,,,Researcher,"you can you can press a little harder until it turns green just check the Wi Fi because sometimes networks not really working. Okay. Yeah, and so this book is basically a tutorial to get you to know how to interact and communicate with Misty Okay, and then when we get to the book, you can basically read as naturally or normally as you want, but then just just having the awareness and these features in mind that they're available for you to use but there's no right or wrong way to interact with Misty just any way that you're more comfortable with. Sounds cool.Yeah, I'm trying to test if it's the network's problem was a problem with the tag we can potentially restart it",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,23:57,,,Parent,with a different app Can you hook it to our hotspot or anything? It's wired into our,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,24:07:00,,,Researcher,wait for one minute and then we'll get rebooted sorry about no worries. It's still in the very early stage of development. So using what we have here and try to explore the idea see. What about adding this one,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,24:38:00,,,Parent,there's 2 mistys over here and 1 misty over there. How many mysteries are there,,,1,,,,,,,,,,2,1,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

10,26:52:00,,,Parent,"Okay, so",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,26:56:00,,,Researcher,the standard process,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,26:58:00,A2-1,,Robot,my friends at UW Madison prepared a booklet so I can teach you what I can do. One thing you need to know about me is that I sometimes have difficulty understanding what you say. So the best way to communicate with me is through some special tags can you first show me the special tag on the back of the book named read with Misty,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,27:24:00,A2-1,,Researcher,"Youcan start here ,",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,27:27:00,A2-1,,Parent,Misty has a thought to share,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,27:32:00,A2-1,,Robot,perfect now you know how to let me know which book you want to read. Oh you can start reading the book named read with Misty to me,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,27:51:00,A2-1,,Child,this,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,27:56:00,A2-1,,Robot,how many cats can you see on the bottom of this page,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,28:03:00,A2-1,,Child,3,,,,,,,,,1,,1,,3,1,,,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

10,28:19:00,A2-1,,Parent,"press the left front button,",,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,
10,28:21:00,A2-1,,Researcher,"but so so that means every time Misty has a thought to share we can scan the tag and then Misty will have it you have an option to listen to the response by clicking this one button. Okay, yeah.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,28:32:00,A2-1,,Parent,Misty has another thought.,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,29:23:00,A2-1,,Robot,Would you like to start reading together,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
